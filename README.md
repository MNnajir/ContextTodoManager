# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## ContextTodoManager
ContextTodoManager is a project name that conveys a clear purpose and functionality 
for a todo management application built with React. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of its components.


# Features Overview
-Add Todos: Users can input new tasks and add them to the list.
-Toggle Completion: Clicking on a todo item toggles its completion status, visually indicating whether it's done.
-Delete Todos: Each todo has a delete button to remove it from the list.
-Local Storage: The app saves todos in the browser's local storage, so they persist even when the page is refreshed.
-Responsive Design: The app can be styled to be mobile-friendly, making it usable on various devices.
## Summary
The ContextTodoManager project leverages the React Context API for efficient state management, allowing for a clean and organized approach to building a todo application. It provides essential features that enhance user productivity, while also being extendable for future improvements like filtering, sorting, or additional categories.
